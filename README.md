# Hey there! üëã

I'm Krystiyan ‚Äî a curious and driven <b>Data Scientist | AI Software Engineer</b> who enjoys building smart tools, untangling messy data, and automating the boring bits. I love figuring out the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind anything and everything, whether it‚Äôs uncovering patterns in a massive dataset or improving the way a project works.

Professionally, I specialize in engineering end-to-end AI/ML solutions, from modernizing legacy systems into efficient Python pipelines to deploying robust, containerized applications on cloud platforms (AWS and Azure). My focus is on creating practical, scalable, and maintainable software. I have also gained hands-on experience (though limited) with LLMs in production environments, exploring their potential for streamlining workflows and enhancing user experiences.
