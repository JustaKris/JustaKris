## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a curious and driven **Data Scientist | AI/ML Engineer** who enjoys figuring out the "why" behind anything and everything, with a Data Science background, focused on building practical, production-ready AI systems and modern cloud-native applications.

I enjoy turning messy data, legacy workflows, and vague business problems into clean Python pipelines, deployable ML services, and useful AI-powered tools. I'm especially interested in the intersection of Machine Learning, Generative AI, and software engineering — where models actually ship and create real impact. My philosophy: understand the **why** behind a model, not just the how.

### 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On

My recent work focuses on modernizing legacy analytical systems and building end-to-end AI/ML solutions. While most of this work lives in private company repositories, it includes:

- 🏗️ Designing and maintaining **scalable Python pipelines** for data processing and ML workflows
- 🔄 Re-engineering legacy statistical projects (SPSS/R) into modern, maintainable Python systems
- 🤖 Building and deploying **ML models** for real business use cases — forecasting, imputation, TV viewing prediction, and classification
- 🚀 Deploying containerized applications on **AWS** (Lambda, ECS/Fargate, S3, ALB) with CI/CD pipelines
- 💬 Prototypeing **RAG-based chatbot systems** using modern LLM stacks (embeddings, vector search, prompt engineering)
- 🧠 Creating internal AI tools for database exploration, automation, and analytics support

### 🌱 Recent Projects & AI Work

- **RAG-based Chatbot Systems**: End-to-end chatbot using retrieval-augmented generation for contextual QA
- **ML Models in Production**: Forecasting models, imputation pipelines, and TV viewing prediction systems
- **Box Office Predictions**: Analysis for movies and TV shows, incorporating data collection via APIs and web scraping
- **Medical AI**: CNN-based Chest X-ray image classification with deployment focus
- **NLP Pipelines**: Text analysis, semantic search, and LLM-powered automation tools
- **Continuous Learning**: Expanding knowledge in Cloud Technologies, Machine Learning, MLOps, and Generative AI

### 💡 What Drives Me

- 🚀 Building ML systems that actually ship and create impact
- 📊 Understanding the "why" behind it all — defining problems clearly and turning complex data into actionable insights
- ⚡ Making AI tools usable in real workflows, not just notebooks
- ⚡ Automating repetitive tasks to focus on what matters
- 🎸 Balancing tech with music, fitness, and too many movies, series, and games
- 🤝 Always open to collaboration, fun side projects, or chatting tech!
